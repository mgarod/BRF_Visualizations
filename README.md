On Saturday, October 15th to 16th, computer science, education, and geography students from Hunter College travelled upstate for an interdisciplinary excursion to Black Rock Forest Consortium. The trip coordinators were able to purchase twelve Arudino microcontrollers and sensors for use as minature weather stations with the generous funding from Hunter College President Jennifer Raab's Initiative to Increase Student Engagement and Co-curricular Activity.

Prior to the trip, computer science professor Eric Schweitzer held workshops for students to aid in the construction of the twelve Arudino devices.
